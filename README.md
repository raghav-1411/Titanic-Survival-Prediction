# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and travel data.

---

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- **Preprocess** and clean the Titanic dataset
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract meaningful insights
- Handle **missing values** and encode categorical features
- Train classification models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy metrics**

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to:
- Understand feature distributions and relationships
- Visualize survival rates based on attributes like **Sex**, **Pclass**, **Age**, **Fare**, etc.
- Detect and address outliers and missing values
- Guide feature engineering and model decisions

Visualizations include:
- Count plots
- Histograms
- Correlation heatmaps
- Box plots for class-based distributions
